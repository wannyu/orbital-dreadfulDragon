I’ll help to keep track of it and remind you to consume it before it expires! \nIf you are unsure of servings portions, visit this link: https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/2044/know-your-servings-photo-guide \n\n/addmany: If you have multiple food items to add to your foodstock, use this command to add it in all at once.\n\n/consume: Everytime you consume a certain type of food, tell me exactly what you consumed, the amount and I’ll remove it from the list. \n\n/consumemany: If you have consumed multiple food items, use this command to update me all at once.\n\n/list: This allows you to view a list of all the available food you have at any point in time. \n\n/edit: Use this command to edit the food name, servings or expiry date in your food stock.\n\n/edit_household_members: Use this command to edit any changes in the number of people in your household.\n\n/points: If you are curious about how many points you have accumulated, use this command to find out.\n\n/cancel: Use this command to get to the main menu if you want to exit /add, /addmany, /consume, /consumemany or /edit command. \n\n *IMPORTANT* \nPlease be consistent in entering the food names (eg. if previously /add was used to add an 'apple', when you /consume, 'apple' should be entered instead of 'apples'.")
