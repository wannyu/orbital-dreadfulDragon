Orbital Project 2022 (Apollo 11)

We recognise that increasing food wastage is a significant problem in Singapore especially in households. Common reasons include buying too much food and forgetting about food in their fridge. Hence, our project aims to reduce food wastage by providing users an interactive food log through a Telegram Bot. The bot would help to keep track of usersâ€™ food as long as they update their log whenever they purchase or consume food. By reminding users to consume their soon-to-be expired food and alerting them of potential overbuy, we hope to address the root causes of household food wastage.
